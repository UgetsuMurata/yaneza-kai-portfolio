It also updates these attributes as new nodes are inserted, allowing users to see how the tree evolves.

The goal was to create a compact, reliable system that could automatically detect vehicle crashes and send emergency SMS alerts to pre-registered phone numbers. Designed with real-world applications in mind, the device is activated by the driver and uses crash-detection logic to trigger alerts in the event of a collision‚Äîensuring that help can be notified even if the driver is incapacitated. I was primarily responsible for the programming logic‚Äîdeveloping the system that detects impact and triggers alerts‚Äîand also contributed to the design and hardware integration alongside the team. The result was a functional and practical solution that demonstrates how accessible embedded systems can be applied to real-world safety challenges.",

Players navigate through real-life economic situations‚Äîmaking choices, solving challenges, and learning through consequence-based outcomes. I contributed to the game's design and logic, helping ensure that core economics lessons such as supply and demand, scarcity, opportunity cost, and market systems are taught in a way that‚Äôs both engaging and aligned with educational standards. Merkado demonstrates how gamification and storytelling can meaningfully enhance classroom learning and student retention.",
